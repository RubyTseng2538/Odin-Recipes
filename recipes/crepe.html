    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Crêpes are thin pancakes that can be filled with a variety of sweet or savory fillings. They are versatile and can be enjoyed for breakfast, lunch, or dessert.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ cup soy milk</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>¼ cup melted soy margarine</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons maple syrup</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon turbinado sugar</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>Mix flour, soy milk, water, 1/4 cup soy margarine, maple syrup, sugar, and salt together in a large mixing bowl until combined; cover and chill for 2 hours. </p>
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>Lightly grease a 6-inch skillet with some soy margarine. Heat the skillet over medium heat. </p>
    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>Pour 2 to 3 tablespoons of batter into the skillet and immediately rotate the skillet to spread batter out in a thin layer. Cook until the top of the crêpe is no longer wet and the bottom has turned light brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Run a spatula around the edge of the skillet to loosen crêpe; flip and cook until the other side has turned light brown, about 1 minute more. Repeat with remaining batter. </p>
